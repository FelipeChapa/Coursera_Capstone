    "Considering the various expensive house prices in the different neighborhood and boroughs of New York, a careful analysis of current house prices as well as future house market house price prediction are important for consideration when deciding on which house to buy. For this scenario, we will assume the investor is interested in buying residential homes in New York. Specifically, I am interested in analyzing the price of houses in heach neighborhood, amount of houses bought/sold, location analysis, an unsupervised clustering analysis, as well as a regression in order to predict future house value for the prospective neighborhoods.\n",
